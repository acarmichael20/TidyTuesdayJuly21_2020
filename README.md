## RSPCA Interactions With Cats and Dogs

[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) makes a dataset available for data junkies to practice their data manipulation and statistical skills with.  Many thanks to the TidyTuesday peeps, working with their datasets and seeing how other people approach the same datasets is very educational.

Below is a quick explaination of the work I have done using the data from the [RSPCA dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-07-21/readme.md) posted July 21, 2020

## My approach
